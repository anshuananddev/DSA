    //As we iterate over the array, we push indices onto a stack only if the value at
    // the current index is smaller than or equal to the value at the index on top of
    // the stack. This ensures that the stack contains a list of potential starting points
    // for ramps, in decreasing order of value. The key insight is that when we encounter
    // a larger value, we begin popping indices from the stack. For each index popped,
    // we calculate the ramp width formed with the current index and check if it exceeds
    // the maximum width we have tracked. Since the values on the stack are always decreasing,
    // popping an index means that we have found a ramp where the condition nums[i]â‰¤nums[j]
    // is satisfied.

        // due to last '9' , so we will never be able to consider the that window .
